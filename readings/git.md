# Git Readings
----------
## try these ones here, or feel free to suggest other good resources: ##

[try github](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

[git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

these both contain a bit more information than what we need for this, so if you
don't understand some of it, that's fine.  Mostly what you need to understand
is:

- git init 
- git status
- git pull
- git add
- git commit
- git push

Later on, we might implement more stuff with branching and pull requests, or we
might not, idk.  Again, if you find something that helped you, link it here!

As a side note, this format is called markdown, which you can read up on
[here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
