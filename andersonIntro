Hello!
I've done a little bit of work with cybersecurity both during high school internship and during the NCL competition last year. I'm excited to learn everything that comes my way becasue cybersecurity is such a broad topic and learning it in a formatted classroom setting is going to be great for me personally. I really hope to get as much as I can out of this course, if not create a platfrom for this class to be expanded on in future years.
